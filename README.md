# TimePast

TimePast is a local-first Windows desktop productivity app for time entries, smart sticky notes, basic reminders, and Pomodoro sessions.

## Install

Download the latest Windows installer from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/secure-artifacts/Timepast2/releases):

- `TimePast_0.1.3_x64-setup.exe` for the standard installer
- `TimePast_0.1.3_x64_en-US.msi` for MSI deployment

All app data is stored locally on the user's machine.

## Verify Software Origin

Release assets are built and uploaded by GitHub Actions. After downloading an
installer, verify its provenance with GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh attestation verify ./TimePast_0.1.3_x64-setup.exe --repo secure-artifacts/Timepast2
gh attestation verify ./TimePast_0.1.3_x64_en-US.msi --repo secure-artifacts/Timepast2
```

Successful verification means the installer was produced by the official CI
workflow for this repository.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run tauri dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
npm run tauri build
```

## Release

Versioned releases are created from Git tags:

```bash
git tag -a v0.1.3 -m "Release v0.1.3"
git push org2 main
git push org2 v0.1.3
```

The GitHub Actions release workflow builds the Windows installers and attaches them to the GitHub Release.
